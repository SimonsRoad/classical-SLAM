> Real-time Dense Point Cloud, Digital Surface Map (DSM) and (Ortho-)Mosaic Generation for UAVs  

- Load camera poses from different formats (such as PIX4D, COLMAP)  
- Generates a dense point cloud from raw images, camera poses and camera intrinsics  
- Generates Digital Surface Models (DSMs) from raw point clouds and exports e.g. to GeoTiff format  
- Different methods to generate (ortho-)mosaics from raw images, camera poses and camera intrinsics
